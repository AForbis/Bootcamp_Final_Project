__Topic__: Can we use NBA player data to train a machine learning model to reliably predict whether or not a player will make an All-NBA team at the end of a season.
  
__Reason for selecting the topic__: We selected this topic because we are avid sports fans and were curious about the predictability of various end-of-season awards based on a player's end-of-season statistics, biographical data, popularity, and other metrics. 
  
__Data sources__:

- [Season_Stats.csv from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/drgilermo/nba-players-stats) This contains the ___ data.
- [player_data.csv from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/drgilermo/nba-players-stats) This contains the ___ data.
- [All-NBA data.csv from Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/all_league.html) This contains the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd All-NBA team awards from 1946-2020.
