# All-NBA Team Machine Learning Model

## Project Overview

__Topic__

- Can we use NBA player data to train a machine learning model to reliably predict whether or not a player will make an All-NBA team at the end of a season.
  
__Reason for selecting the topic__ 

- We selected this topic because we are avid sports fans and were curious about the predictability of various end-of-season awards based on a player's end-of-season statistics, demographic data, popularity, and other metrics. 
  
__Data sources__

- [Season_Stats.csv from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/drgilermo/nba-players-stats) - This dataset contains a variety of players' game statistics like points, rebounds, assists, PER, etc.
- [All-NBA data.csv from Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/all_league.html) - This dataset contains the list 1st, 2nd, and 3rd All-NBA team awards from 1946-2020.
- [player_data.csv from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/drgilermo/nba-players-stats) - This dataset contains the players' demographic data (e.g., start/end of career, birthdate, height, weight, college).

__Questions we hope to answer with the data__

- asdf 

__Team Communication Protocols__

- Questions and updates are posted in the group Slack channel and all team members' phone numbers are available in case emergency communication is necessary.
- Meetings outside of Monday and Wednesday classes are coordinated in the group Slack channel and are scheduled as needed.
- Merge requests, comments, and other Github activity are set up to automatically notify the "Github Master" via email.

## Database

- This means you're using a SQL-based database, including an ERD of the database and a document pointing out how it is integrated into your database and how it works with the code. 
- When you submit this database for your weekly grade, make sure you're submitting the data used for testing as well. Make sure to upload it to the repository along with the rest of the database-related work.

## Machine Learning Model

- The first segment is all about preparation, so a simple model will cover the first question—the type of machine learning model chosen and why. To get started, create a simple model that isn't concerned with accuracy. Basically, you want your model to take input data and return a label—and that's it!
