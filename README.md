# All-NBA Team Machine Learning Model

__Topic__: Can we use NBA player data to train a machine learning model to reliably predict whether or not a player will make an All-NBA team at the end of a season.
  
__Reason for selecting the topic__: We selected this topic because we are avid sports fans and were curious about the predictability of various end-of-season awards based on a player's end-of-season statistics, demographic data, popularity, and other metrics. 
  
__Data sources__:

- [Season_Stats.csv from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/drgilermo/nba-players-stats) - This dataset contains a variety of players' game statistics like points, rebounds, assists, PER, etc.
- [All-NBA data.csv from Basketball Reference](https://www.basketball-reference.com/awards/all_league.html) - This dataset contains the list 1st, 2nd, and 3rd All-NBA team awards from 1946-2020.
- [player_data.csv from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/drgilermo/nba-players-stats) - This dataset contains the players' demographic data (e.g., start/end of career, birthdate, height, weight, college).

__Questions we hope to answer with the data__: asdf 


## Communication Protocols

## Documenting data methods

- Cutting off data before 1978 because of null values in various columns
- Separating out positions to different columns names
- Recalculated certain columns to per game stats
